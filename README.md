This is a side project to explore coding techniques and technology I am
learning about during Launch Academy in Boston, MA.

The purpose of the project is to allow lecturers to share open ended questions
and code-based challenges with a group of people listening to their lecture to
promote engagement and discussion in coding lectures.
